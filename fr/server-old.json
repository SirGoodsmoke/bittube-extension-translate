Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and BitTube are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.",

If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to BitTube should be sent to Wartenbergstrasse 41, CH-4052 Basel, Swizerland, Attn: Operations Department (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If BitTube and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or BitTube may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by BitTube or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or BitTube is entitled",
		"TermsOfServiceText71": "Arbitration Procedures",
		"TermsOfServiceText72": "Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the German Arbitration Institute’s (DIS) rules and procedures, including the DIS’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “DIS Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the DIS, please visit its website, http://www.disarb.org/em/. Information about the DIS Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the DIS’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.disarb.org/. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the DIS Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.",
		"TermsOfServiceText73": "Unless BitTube and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by DIS. If your claim is for €10,000 or less, BitTube agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the DIS Rules. If your claim exceeds €10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the DIS Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.",
		"TermsOfServiceText74": "Costs of Arbitration",
		"TermsOfServiceText75": "Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the DIS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is €75,000 or less, at your request, BitTube will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than €75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, BitTube will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, BitTube will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Finally, if the value of the relief sought is €75,000 or less, BitTube will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. BitTube will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. But, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than €75,000 in relief, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the DIS Rules.",

If a court decides that any of the provisions of clause (b) of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this Agreement will continue to apply.",

		"TermsOfServiceText81": "Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, BitTube agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending BitTube written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement.",

		"TermsOfServiceText85": "If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement are for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired and shall remain in full force and effect, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) shall be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable provision or provisions that comes closest to the intent of the parties underlying the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s).",
		"TermsOfServiceText86": "The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.",
		"TermsOfServiceText87": "If BitTube is unable to perform any obligation under this Agreement because of any matter beyond its reasonable control, such as lightning, flood, exceptionally severe weather, fire, explosion, war, civil disorder, industrial disputes (whether or not involving employees of BitTube), acts of local or central government or other competent authorities, problems with telecommunications providers, hostile network attacks or other events beyond BitTube’s reasonable control (each, a “Force Majeure Event”), BitTube will have no liability to you for such failure to perform; provided, however, that BitTube shall resume performance promptly upon removal of the circumstances constituting the Force Majeure Event. If any Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) days, either BitTube or you may terminate this Agreement by delivery of written notice to the other party. You will remain responsible for all Fees incurred through the last day the Services were available. If you and BitTube have executed a separate user Agreement applicable to your access to and use of the Site, Services and/or Software, then the terms and conditions of such Subscription Agreement shall prevail to the extent of any conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In all other cases, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between BitTube and you with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between BitTube and you. No waiver or modification of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.",
